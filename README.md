# auth0-mvccore
Sample of Auth0 and ASP.NET MVC Core, using both Cookie and Bearer Authentication

I hope this helps people who were stuck like I was, in trying to figure out how to Auth0 cookies based authentication for the web site, while configuring API to only use Bearer tokens, within the same app.
